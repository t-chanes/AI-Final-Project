# This project was made in collaboration with Tanner Bibb and Samantha Kuenzi at the University of Texas at San Antonio during the Spring 2023 semester. This project was created for an Artificial Intelligence class. The model takes in an input from the user and compares the image submitted to those the model already recognizes. It then compares the images and gives the submitted image an animal name based on which animal it most closely looks like.
